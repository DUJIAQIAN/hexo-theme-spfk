In order to make myself more clear about the knowledge that I have learned and share them with others, I decided to create a self-blog.

Hexo is a fast, simple & powerful blog framework. And I chose to use hexo for easing the job.

I find a good theme **spfk** from site https://hexo.io/themes/index.html. 

Because of personel preference and habits, I made some changements of the theme spfk.

Attention: if you want to use the origianal theme spfk, please git clone http://luuman.github.io/categories/Hexo/
